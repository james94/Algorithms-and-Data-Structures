# Data Structures & Algorithms

Learn, analyze and implement Data Structures using C and C++. Learn Recursion and Sorting.

## Overview

I have already taken a Data Structures & Algorithms course at SJSU for undergrad in Computer Engineering.
I decided to take this course on Udemy to gain a deeper understanding of Data Structures & Algorithms.
My instructor on Udemy is Abdul Bari who has been teaching this course for a long period of time to university students.
My goal with this course is to take what I learn and apply it to solving challenging coding problems on Leetcode. 
I hope after completing this course, I will have a better time getting through the coding challenges that
come up in interviews.
