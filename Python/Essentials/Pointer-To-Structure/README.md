# Pointer to Structure

In Python Essentials, you will implement 2 ways to use a pointer to point to a structure. The first approach simulates a pointer using a list mutable object to point to a dataclass. The second approach uses a real C pointer using ctypes to point to a class ctypes structure.

**Code:** [main.py](src/main.py)

**CMakeLists.txt:** [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt)
